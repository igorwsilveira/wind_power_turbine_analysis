# Wind Power Turbine Analysis Overview

With each passing day the demand for renewable energies increases exponentially, along with the influence of large industrial sectors such as Automotive, which in recent years has completely changed its business model based on the transformation of combustion vehicles to electric, thus generating a domino effect in several other sectors of the economy.

With this, the search for solar and wind energy is increasing exponentially, and with this we can obtain valuable data to understand how these technologies can help our day-to-day lives.

This project is an analysis of a wind turbine in which we can see its performance in power generation (kW) along with other fundamental parameters, such as date, wind speed, theoretical curve, among others.


## Data Source

The Dataset was extracted from Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset).

## Analysis

Just like all data analysis, we must always start by determining the main objective, which are formed by questions for the direction of the analysis throughout its process.

In this project, the main objective of the analysis is to check if any changes in the operation of the wind turbine with data collected from it.

Giving an overview about the general condition of the turbine site, this way they can visualize the outliers and raise questions about the performance, issues, and improvements that need to be made

The analysis process consists of 5 steps, in which they can vary from company to company, both for more and for less:

1. Ask (Business Challenge, Objectives or Questions)           

2. Prepare (Data Generation, Collection and Storage)

3. Process (Data Cleaning and Data Integrity)

4. Analyze (Data exploration, Visualization, and Analysis)

5. Share (Communication and Interpreting Results).
